Scholarly Marking Studio — Academic Assessment Reimagined
Scholarly Marking Studio is a precision-built academic assessment environment designed to help educators, examiners, and institutions evaluate student work with rigour, transparency, and alignment to global frameworks.
It blends scholarly judgment with automation — supporting evaluators rather than replacing them — ensuring every mark is reasoned, fair, and developmentally useful.

🎓 Core Purpose
To transform the marking process into a structured scholarly dialogue between evaluator and learner.
The system supports consistent, framework-aligned grading across disciplines while promoting integrity, fairness, and professional feedback standards.

🧩 Key Features


Rubric-Aligned Evaluation: Weighted criteria and rubric templates based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, NQF, and HEQSF frameworks.


Transparent Feedback Engine: Produces a clear audit trail — executive summary, weighted rubric table, narrative feedback, and framework alignment notes.


Developmental Guidance: Automatically suggests growth areas and developmental actions without altering assessor judgement.


Fairness Across Contexts: Calibrated for cross-disciplinary and multicultural academic environments.


Export-Ready Reports: Generates Markdown, CSV, or PDF reports suitable for institutional moderation or external examiners.


Data Ethics & Integrity: Secure, transparent, and compliant with academic integrity principles.



🔍 Guiding Philosophy

“Mark like a scholar, not a search engine.”
Every evaluation produced through Scholarly Marking Studio is evidence-based, criterion-referenced, and accompanied by explanatory reasoning that reinforces the academic value of feedback.
